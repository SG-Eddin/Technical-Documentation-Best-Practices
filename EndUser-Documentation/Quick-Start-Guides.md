# Quick Start Guides
Quick Start Guides are also know as 'Quick Reference Guides'

Before writing, you need to decide what type of guide you are writing to figure out what you want your guide to accomplish.

1. Will your quick start guide help your user to learn about your product, process, or tool?
2. Tell you user how to do the series of steps required to get started? (a series of steps to get started guides are known as procedural guides"
3. Or tell your user how to do a single task?
