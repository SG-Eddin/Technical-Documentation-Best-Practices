# Quick Start Guides
Quick Start Guides are also know as 'Quick Reference Guides'

Before writing, you need to decide what type of guide you are writing to figure out what you want your guide to accomplish.

1. Will your quick start guide help your user to learn about your product, process, or tool?
2. Tell you user how to do the series of steps required to get started? (a series of steps to get started guides are known as procedural guides"
3. Or tell your user how to do a single task?

## Adding visuals
Any visual you are adding to your quick start guide ***must be useful to your user***

**Flow charts** is a great option if you are writing about how a process works.

Example:

**Screenshots** is used if you are writing a quick start guide for a software, a game, an app, or system.
Usually, these screenshots are annotated with arrows or markings to draw the user's attention to details in the image itself. Annotated screenshots are helpful when a user interface has lots of options or the specific button you want them to click is difficult to describe in words.

***Best practices for annotated screenshots***

- Be consistent. Use the same markup each time in you want the user to point out something in a screenshot throughout your guide. for wxample, if you are using a red arrow on the first screenshot, don't switch to a red circle on the second screenshot. That will be confucing.

- Use numbers to indicate a series of options in one screenshot, don't take a screenshot for every step by itself.

*Example:*

# Best Practices

1. Base yout quick-start guide on your full user manual. Pick out topics listed in the full user manual that should be included in the quick-start guide.
2. Identify the overall purpose of the guide by explaining the outcome
3. Address your reader directly using you or the imperative form.
Add headings to group the instructions into smaller sets.
Move supplementary information such as notes to before the actual instruction.
Begin each step with a verb.
