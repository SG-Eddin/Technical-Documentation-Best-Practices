# Requirements Writing Styles
There is no right or wrong in choosing the style of writing the requirements. It is based on the level of details and the specifications required by your project.

## User Stories
In agile (and its frameworks: scrum and kanban): A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer. The purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer.
User story is one or more sentence(s) in a simple language or a business language that captures what users need to do.

User stories are meant to keep all of the requirements of your system to a consistent format. They are easy to write, to read, and easy to evaluate.

On a project, you and your team decide if this is the best way to follow.

### User Stories Structure and Design

          |        
 ---------|------------
**Format:** | ```As a <type of user>, I want to <task/function>, so that <reason>```

**Examples:** | 1: *As a <**patient**>, I want <**to receive an SMS when my prescription is ready to pick up**>, so that <**I can avoid unnecessary waiting at the pharmacy**>*
              | 2: *As a <**pharmacist**>, I want to <**enroll a patient in the SMS notification service**>, so that <**they can receive notifications when their prescriptions are ready to pick up**>*

**Benefits:** | Brief, understandable by users and developers, iterative, and easy to estimate effort.

**Limitations:** | Lack of performance, non-functional details, and open to interpretation.

### Display
User stories are typically written on sticky notes and pasted on a wall or a board where the whole team can see them. 

During the development phase, these sticky notes with the user stories are pasted on the backlog column, team members take off the sticky note (with the user story) and place it on a column of Work in Progress (WIP).

This visualizes what's done, what's in progress, and what's not started.
