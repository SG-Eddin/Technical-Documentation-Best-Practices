# Requirements Overview
Poor Requirements = Project Failure

> **Requirements** helps to clearly define client needs, detects errors early before they become expensive to fix, and to ensure that the product you are developing meets the needs of your client.
 
There are three main goals to be achieved to make a better software:
- The right product
- Done right
- Managed right

## The Right Product
To identify the right product, you must understand the needs of your client, not only what they want.
You need to understand:
- What is the problem they need to solve?
- What are the tasks they need to do (using the software)?
- Who will use this software and how will the user interact with it?

By answering these questions, you will translate the clients' needs into developers' language so that they can build the product.

## Done Right, and Managed Right
To get the product done and managed right, the development team must have clear requirements to be planned, designed, implemented, and tested.

How do you ensure that your requirements are done well?
the answer is **practicing requirements activities**.

Activities comes in the specification phase where you define what your product will do and how it will do it.

### Eliciting Requirements
In order to have better requirements, you - as a business analyst, product owner, or product manager - need to be more involved and interactive with your clients. This is called *requirement elicitation* and it is much better than *gathering* requirements (which is just taking a list of things they want), the difference is how you *interact* with the client.

### Presenting Requirements
Clients' needs (requirements) can be represented in few forms, most common of them:
- Use Cases
- User Stories
- Story boards.
> Requirements representation can be textual or graphical, or both.

### Prioritizing Requirements
If you are working in a Scrum environment (even if you don't I think this is an important step), you need to prioritize the big requirement list of your client into:
- Must Do
- Should Do
- Could Do

### Analyzing Requirements
While you are creating the list of requirements (that you will present to developers), you need to analyze them to make sure that they are:
- Complete
- Clear
- Consistent
> Refer to [Characteristics of Writing a Good Requirements](https://github.com/SG-Eddin/Technical-Documentation-Best-Practices/blob/main/Requirements-Writing.md#characteristics-of-requirements).
By analyzing requirements, you make sure that all the requirements you created work well together and they accurately reflect the product which will be built.

### Managing Requirements
The most important aspect of managing requirements is that:

**Each requirement needs to be referred to by the developers from many places, just like their code, tests, and change logs.**

Meaning: When a requirement changes, everyone involved needs to know that it happened and to understand the impact on other requirements.
