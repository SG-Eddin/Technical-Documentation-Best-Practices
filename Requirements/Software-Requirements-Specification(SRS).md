# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Description of a software system to be developed. It ties together the requirements that were mentioned earlier.

## SRS Goals
- Facilitates reviews
- Describes the scope of work
- Serves as a reference to software designers (i.e. navigation aids, documents structure, etc.)
- Provides a framework for testing primary and secondary use cases.
- Links features to customer requirements and is used to trace the requirements that the stakeholder requested and ensure that each feature can be tracked back to the requirement that was documented.
- Provides a platform for ongoing refinement (if questions came up or the team found something missing or incomplete, they can refer back to the SRS and build on it.
