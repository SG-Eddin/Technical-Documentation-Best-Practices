# Requirements Types
To get the most out of the requirements, you need to think of it as:
- A list of features which should be included in the final version of the product.
- A let of description of how the product should perform in different situations.
- The reason why that product should exit in the first place.

This will help you to describe:
- What the product should be like.
- How it should work.
- Why it should be done in the first place.

Now, let's see the requirements' types that will bring these points together:

1. ```Business Requirements```
2. ```Business Rules``` What rules must be followed while building the product?
3. ```User Requirements``` What tasks end-users can do with the product?
4. ```Functional Requirements``` What the product should do or support?
5. ```Non-Functional Requirements``` How well a product must perform, or the quality factor of the product?
6. ```Development Constraints Requirements```That outline the implementation technology, conventions, documentation, and the process which the team will use.

## Business Requirements
Business requirements answer the question of *'Why the product should be created?'*
