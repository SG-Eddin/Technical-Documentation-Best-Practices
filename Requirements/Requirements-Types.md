# Requirements Types
It was mentioned in [Presenting Requirements](https://github.com/SG-Eddin/Technical-Documentation-Best-Practices/blob/main/Requirements/Requirements-Overview.md#presenting-requirements) that you can present clients' needs in few forms. 

To get the most out of the requirements, you need to think of it as:
- A list of features which should be included in the final version of the product.
- A let of description of how the product should perform in different situations.
- The reason why that product should exit in the first place.

This will help you to describe:
- What the product should be like.
- How it should work.
- Why it should be done in the first place.

Now, let's see the requirements' types that will bring these points together:

- **Business Requirements** (why the product should be done?).
- **Business Rules** (what rules must be followed while building the product?).
- **User Requirements** (what tasks end-users can do with the product?).
- **Functional Requirements** (what the product should do or support).
- **Non-Functional Requirements** (how well a product must perform, or the quality factor of the product).

A very important section is the >development constraints requirements
