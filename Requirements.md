# Writing Requirements
                     ``` Poor Requirements = Project Failure ```
Requirements are Functional and Non-Functional.
## Functional Requirements
Functional requiremets are the product features or functions that the developers must implement too enable users to do stuff.
They describe the system beahviour under specific conditions.
To build a successful requirement document, you need to understand what your users need, as it leads the project to be successful, challenged, or to fail.

> **Successful** =
> 1. On time
> 2. On budget
> 3. Satisfactory results.

> **Challenged** = The project is delivered but with
> 1. Over time
> 2. Over budget
> Features and functionality must be modified.

> **Fail** = 
> The project is cancelled during the development cycle.

Requirements are translations from users language to developers language.
