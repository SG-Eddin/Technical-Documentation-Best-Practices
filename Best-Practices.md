# Technical Documentation Best Practices

Technical documentation has a clear, direct and neutral style. The text should present the information in the most professional and accessible way possible.

The following topics will present the fundamentals of technical documentation.

## Define your Audience

> Good documentation = knowledge and skills your audience *needs* to do a task **-** your audience's *current* knowldge and skills

Meaning: Make sure your document provide the information your audience need and which they don't already have.

1. **Identify your audience's role(s).**

Roles are an essential first-order approximation in defining your audience, roles such as:
- Software engineers.
- Technical, non-engineer roles (such as technical program/project managers), or technical sales.
- Non-technical positions.

So, writing a software technical report for software engineers is different from writing a social media article for lay audience about the same software.


2. **Determine what your audience needs to learn.**

Write down a list of the things your target audience needs to perform. Examples:
- Create an account.
- Add a new request.
- Edit page settings.


3. **Use simple words**

English is not the native language of all technical readers. Therefore, use simple words over complex words. Avoid using complex English words.

## Words
The best paragraphs are short and to the point. You can do that by following these points:

1. **Define new / unfamiliar terms**
2. **Use terms consistently**
  - Use the same term consistently throughout your document. Once you've named a component, don't rename it.
  - If you rename a term in the middle of a document, your ideas won't compile (in your users' head).

3. **Acronyms**
   - When you first write an unfamiliar acronym in your document, write the full term, and then put the acronym in parentheses. 
   - Do not cycle back-and-forth between the acronym and the expanded version in the same document.

Example: *This document explains the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) that project managers will use.*
