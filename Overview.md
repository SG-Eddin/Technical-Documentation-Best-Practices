# Technical Documentation Overview

Technical Documentation / Technical Writing / Technical Communication, all three give the same meaning which is broadly defined by the [Society of Technical Communication](https://www.stc.org/about-stc/defining-technical-communication/) as:

Any form of communication that shows one or more of the following qualities:

- Communicating about technical or specialized topics, such as computer applications, medical procedures, or environmental regulations.
- Communicating by using technology, such as web pages, help files, or social media sites.
- Providing instructions about how to do something, regardless of how technical the task is or even if technology is used to create or distribute that communication.

This writing style covers any type of text that aims to explain detailed information. A technical writer communicates in a way that presents technical information so that the reader can use that information for an intended purpose.

The value that technical communicators deliver is twofold: They make information more useable and accessible to those who need that information, and in doing so, they advance the goals of the companies or organizations that employ them.
