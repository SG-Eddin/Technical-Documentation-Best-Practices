# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) / Functional Specifications Document (FSD) / Product Specifications Documet (PSD)
Description of a software system to be developed. It ties together the requirements that were mentioned earlier.

## SRS Goals
- Facilitates reviews
- Describes the scope of work
- Serves as a reference to software designers (i.e. navigation aids, documents structure, etc.)
- Provides a framework for testing primary and secondary use cases.
- Links features to customer requirements and is used to trace the requirements that the stakeholder requested and ensure that each feature can be tracked back to the requirement that was documented.
- Provides a platform for ongoing refinement (if questions came up or the team found something missing or incomplete, they can refer back to the SRS and build on it.

### SRS Example (template from [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/))
- **Table of Contents**
- **Revision History** (*Who made the change, when they made it, and what the change was.*)
  
- **Introduction**
  - Purpose of the document
  - Document Conventions *(naming or formating)*
  - Intended Audience *(Stakeholders, the Dev. team, project managers)*
  - Project Scope *(is it for the entire system or just one component)*
  - References *(references to other documents or external materials)*

- **Overall Description**
  - Product Perspective *(context or origin of the system)*
  - Product Functions *(major functions that the system will perform)*
  - User Classes and Characteristics
  - Operating Environment *(on which the system will run)*
  - Design and Implementation Constraints
  - User Documentation *(what type of the documentation will be delivered with the software?)*
  - Assumptions and Dependencies

> In the following sections, you can use: user stories, text-based requirements or use cases mentioned in the earlier documents.

- ** External Interface Requirements**
  - User Interfaces
  - Hardware Interfaces *(describe any device required, ...etc.)*
  - Software Interfaces *(describe browsers, databases, APIs, ...etc.)*
  - Communications Interfaces *(communication functions of the system such as Emails, SMS, ...etc.)*

- **Functional Requirements** (the fuctions of the system and its components including inputs, outputs and behaviour)
  - System Feature 1
  - System Feature 2
  - ....
 
 - **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Performance
   - Safety
   - Security
   - Quality
   ... etc.
   
  - **Other Requirements**
