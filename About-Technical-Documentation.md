# Technical Documentation / Writing

Technical documentation in software engineering includes all written documents and materials dealing with software product development.
Technical writing is not just about understanding technical information and recording it in a document, technical writing takes high-level information and processes it into digestible content for a specific audience

### Definition

Technical Documentation / Technical Writing falls under *Technical Communication* which is broadly defined by the [Society of Technical Communication](https://www.stc.org/about-stc/defining-technical-communication/) (STC) as:

Any form of communication that shows one or more of the following qualities:

- Communicating about technical or specialized topics, such as computer applications, medical procedures, or environmental regulations.
- Communicating by using technology, such as web pages, help files, or social media sites.
- Providing instructions about how to do something, regardless of how technical the task is or even if technology is used to create or distribute that communication.

### Value

The value that technical communicators deliver is twofold: They make information more useable and accessible to those who need that information, and in doing so, they advance the goals of the companies or organizations that employ them.

What all technical communicators have in common is a user-centered approach to providing the right information, in the right way, at the right time to make someone’s life easier and more productive.

The following examples illustrate the value of the products technical communicators produce or the services they provide *(highlighting only the technology-related)*:

- Software instructions help users be more successful on their own, improving how easily those products gain acceptance into the marketplace and reducing costs to support them.
- Functional specifications and proposals help one group of technical experts communicate effectively with other technical experts, speeding up development cycles, reducing rework caused by misunderstandings, and eliminating risks associated with miscommunication.
- Training programs provide people with new or improved skills, making them more employable and their organizations and products more efficient and safe.
- Technical illustrations clarify steps or identify the parts of a product, letting users focus on getting their task done quickly or more accurately.
- Usability studies uncover problems with how products present themselves to users, helping those products become more user friendly.

### Benefits

Technical writers have the great benefit of becoming lifelong learners. 
In order to communicate the content, you must be (or become) well-versed in that field. Therefore, with each new technical document, you will become an expert on that subject.

## Project Documentation

There are different types of documents produced through the software development lifecycle (SDLC). These documents explain the product functions, unify project-related information, and allow discussion between stakeholders and developers.

### Development Approaches and Documentation

Documentiation that the team produces depends on the software development approach that the team chose, whether Waterfall or Agile. Each of these approaches has a unique documentation technique:

- **The Waterfall approach**: Teams create detailed documentation before any of the engineering stages begin.
- **The Agile approach**: Doesn’t require comprehensive documentation at the beginning. One of the Agile Manifesto values suggests, putting – “working software over comprehensive documentation -“, the idea is to produce documentation with information that is essential to move forward, when it makes the most sense.


### Software Documentation Classifications

Software documentation can be devided into two main categories:
- [Product documentation](https://github.com/SG-Eddin/Technical-Documentation-Best-Practices/blob/main/About-Technical-Documentation.md#product-documentation)
- Process documentation

 #### Product Documentation

Describes the product that will be developed and provides instructions on how to perform the tasks needed.

Product documentation includes:
- **[System documentation](https://github.com/SG-Eddin/Technical-Documentation-Best-Practices/tree/main/System-Documentation.md)**: describe the system itself for the team through the following documents:
  - [Requirements](https://github.com/SG-Eddin/Technical-Documentation-Best-Practices/tree/main/System-Documentation.md/Requirements.md)
  - [Design and architecture](https://github.com/SG-Eddin/Technical-Documentation-Best-Practices/blob/main/System-Documentation.md/Design%26Architecture-Documentation.md)
  - Code documentation
  - User experience design
  - Testing documents
  
- **[End-User documentation](https://github.com/SG-Eddin/Technical-Documentation-Best-Practices/tree/main/EndUser-Documentation)**: 
   - Business Documents:
     - White papers
     - Proposals
  
  
  - User Documents
    - Installation instructions (installation guide)
    - Quick start guides
    - User manuals (Users and Administrators)
    - Release notes
    - Training materials
    - Tutorials
